# This file represents an exploratory analysis in R
# It will not be built as part of the analysis website by default
# Consider this area the "playground" to pilot analyses that you can organize
# in whatever way suits you best
#
# Once an analysis has matured sufficiently, usually you have to rewrite it
# to make it interpretable both as code and also to communicate the results
# of the analysis.
#
# Thus, one way to think about it is that the _eda folder contains immature
# analyses, some of which will eventually be promoted to a full notebook
# that is ensured to run reproducibly
