Given that the majority of the `msiverse` analytical framework is run through an R-based ecosystem of packages, it naturally is nice to know more about the computing environment that the R language provides. Here I'll point to a previous book section I wrote for a manuscript, ["Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with R/Bioconductor"](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/index.html). The first section details a nice compendium of resources for learning both basic and advanced usage of R as well as resources for learning how to develop in R. Alongside this, I suggest checking out the site on [learning the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/) by RStudio.
